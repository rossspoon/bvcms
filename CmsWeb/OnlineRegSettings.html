<h3>GradeOptions</h3>
<p>These will display a dropdown on the form with the descriptions become the text of the dropdown items. These are all the  the first level indented items below the GradeOptions keyword. There is no keyword denoting these. It is denoted by the indent level.</p>
<p>A Code keyword is required below each description and indented two levels. The value of each code should be an integer.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<pre>GradeOptions: Your youngest child's completed grade<br />  	Elementary School<br />  		Code: 6<br />  	Middle School<br />  		Code: 9<br />  	High School<br />  		Code: 12</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Small Groups and Fees</h3>
<p>In the following documentation, there is a pattern where a SmallGroup keyword shows up along with a Fee keyword, all below the description. If no Small Group is specified, the description itself becomes the name of the SmallGroup. The SmallGroup is used to classify the selection the registrant made and is available for filtering and managing your groups within the organization. You can prefix the small groups with a few letters and a colon like SG:Boys. This can help you distinguish the various sets of small groups.</p>
<p>If a Fee applies, that amount, of course, will tally into the total amount of the transaction.</p>
<h3>AgeGroups</h3>
<p>These don't display on your form. Instead, they serve to classify with a SmallGroup the age that the registrant falls into. You specify an age range (inclusive of both numbers) and if the person falls into that range, they are assigned to that SmallGroup in the Organization.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<pre>AgeGroups:<br />  	0-12<br />  		SmallGroup: Children<br />  		Fee: 5<br />  	13-19<br />  		SmallGroup: Youth<br />  		Fee: 10<br />  	20-99<br />  		SmallGroup: Adults<br />  		Fee: 20</pre>
<h3>ShirtSizes</h3>
<p>These display in a dropdown. The description (first level indents) is displayed in the dropdown text and the SmallGroup values become the SmallGroup name.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<pre>ShirtSizes:<br />  	Small<br />  		SmallGroup: SM<br />  	Medium<br />  		SmallGroup: M<br />  	Large<br />  		SmallGroup: LG<br />  	Extra Large<br />  		SmallGroup: XL
</pre>
<h3>YesNoQuestions</h3>
<p>These become a set of two radio buttons for each question. One for Yes and one for No. The registrant must reply to one or the other. This is unlike checkboxes where it is not required to check a box. This way, you can force an answer, whether negative or positive.</p>
<pre>YesNoQuestions:<br />  	Are you a Facebook User?<br />  		SmallGroup: Facebook<br />  	Are you a Twitter User?<br />  		SmallGroup: Twitter</pre>
<h3>ExtraQuestions</h3>
<p>These become a series of labels with a long text box next to each allowing the registrant to answer the question posed in free form text. This information is stored in the extra data area of the MemberDialog box.</p>
<pre>ExtraQuestions:<br />  	Your Occupation<br />  	Your Favorite Snack</pre>
<h3>MenuItems</h3>
<p>The menu items become a series of labels and textboxes. The description (first level indents) becomes the label and the textbox is used to enter a # of items to be purchased/chosen. If there is a Fee assoicated with an item, it displays next to the textbox. The fees tally into the total fee.</p>
<pre>
MenuItems:<br />  	Fish and Chips<br />  		SmallGroup: Fish<br />  		Fee: 5<br />  	Turkey Sandwich<br />  		SmallGroup: Turkey<br />  		Fee: 4</pre>
<h3>AskOptions</h3>
<p>These display as a dropdown box.</p>
<pre>AskOptions:<br />  	Option 1<br />  		SmallGroup: opt1<br />  		Fee: 10<br />  	Option 2<br />  		SmallGroup: opt2<br />  		Fee: 20<br />  	None of the above<br />  		SmallGroup: none<br />  		Fee: 0</pre>
<h3>ExtraOptions</h3>
<p>These also display as a dropdown box.</p>
<pre>ExtraOptions:
  	Option A
  		SmallGroup: opt1
  		Fee: 1
  	Option B
  		SmallGroup: opt2
  		Fee: 2
  	None of the above
  		SmallGroup: none
  		Fee: 0</pre>
<h3>Checkboxes</h3>
<p>These display as a series of checkboxes. You can optionally specify the minimum and maximum number of checks within the group.</p>
<h3>Checkboxes2</h3>
<p>You can have two sets of checkboxes, each with their own min and max.</p>
<h3>Confirmation</h3>
<p>The email confirmation can be composed in the email text editor then view the Sourcek, copy the HTML code and paste into this section.</p>
<p>This section starts with the Confirmation keyword and has two required first level indent keywords, Subject and Body. The subject can be plain text to the right of the keyword (with the colon:). You can optionally specify an Html: keyword which is a true/false value. If true, you can use HTML for the Body, if not, you use plain text. Although you can place the body of the message to the right of the Body keyword just like you did with the subject, typically you want a multi-line message with perhaps some HTML codes. Since lines and indentations are significant in this text document, there is a special syntax used to enter the multi-line text. The Body keyword has the value of &lt;&lt; (two left pointy brackets). This is the indicator that two special, marker lines will follow. The  next line becomes the marker and is not part of the message. In this case below, we used a line of 10 dash characters. But you could use a word or what ever you want. The only requirement is that this same line show up again marking the end the multi-line message.</p>
<pre>
Confirmation:
	Subject: Your confirmation
	Html: true
	Body: <<
----------
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cms.bellevue.org/images/bvcms130.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Thank you {first},</p>
&lt;p> We will be in touch soon with more information.&lt;/p>
{details}
----------
</pre>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The instructions can also use the Html keyword but typically can all be one liners of text.</p>
<p>There are five messages available. You do not have to use all five. But they show up in the five sections of the login process. </p>
<p>The Login text up when you enter your username and password. </p>
<p>The Find text up when you are entering a First name and a Last name, Birthday, email etc. which are used to locate the record. If it is not found, you can add a new record. So the Find can explain this process a bit more fully if you want.</p>
<p>The Select text shows up after you have logged in with a username and password. You family members will be displayed and you can either select one of them by clicking their name or you can enter another person to find.</p>
<p>The Options text shows up after the record has been found and it is asking for you to filling other information regarding the registration.</p>
<p>Finally the Submit text shows up when you are ready to either complete the registration or to add additional registrants.</p>
<p>Just as with the confirmation email above, you can treat any section as Html and use the multi-line syntax to enter the text.</p>
<pre>
Instructions:
	Select: Choose a family member
	Login: Please login or use the register without account
	Find: This is where we try to find your record
	Sorry: Click here to get on the waiting list
	Html: true
	Options: << 
----------
&lt;p>Fill this information out &lt;i>please</i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will be validated when you submit&lt;/p>
----------</pre>
<h3>Terms</h3>
<p>The terms can be simple or a long document of text. This will show up on the payment page and require that you check an approve box before you can continue. And again, it could be a one liner or use the multi-line text in conjunction with the Html keyword.</p>
<pre>
Terms:
	Body: No lawsuits, OK?
</pre>
